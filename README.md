###### Username notice
My GitHub username has recently been changed from `AngelDTF` to `AngelWyvern` to remove brand association. My apologies if this caused any confusion, I hope to never have to change my username again.

###### OpenParsec notice
OpenParsec has been discontinued after Unity's legal team sent me a cease & desist order. I want to give a huge shout out to these great people that have helped me out with the project: [`@LeaveNhA`](https://github.com/LeaveNhA), [`@bslatyer`](https://github.com/bslatyer), [`@dicksonhk`](https://github.com/dicksonhk), and [`@xiaoxuhuanxiang`](https://github.com/xiaoxuhuanxiang).

### <p align="center"> ‚ÑπÔ∏è About me </p>

Hey all, I'm a self-taught hobbyist software developer that enjoys tinkering with game modding. I'm a bit of a perfectionist and tend to take my time with my work, so please be patient. I also tend to take up projects that are more than I can handle, so understand that a good chunk of my projects are never seeing the light of day.

I mostly work in Haxe and JavaScript, though I've played around in other languages before, with good experience in HTML and CSS, some experience in C#, Java and Swift, and little experience in C and C++.

##### For inquiries, you can reach me at my more business-oriented email: angelbot32@icloud.com
